Goal is to build an agent to play against the user in a connect 4 game using MiniMax Algorithm
# overview of connect4 game
This game Connect-Four is a tic-tac-toe game played by two players.
In this game the players take turns placing pieces on a vertical board.
The board  is 7 columns long and 6 rows high.
 Each player uses pieces of a specific color, usually black and red or sometimes green and red.
The goal is to be the first to get four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.
Since the board is vertical, parts inserted in a certain column always fall in the lowest unoccupied row in that column.
As soon as a column contains 6 parts, it is full and no further parts can be placed on the column.
Both the players begin with 21 similar pieces and the first player to reach a series of four connected pieces wins the game.
If all the players have played and neither player has four parts in a row, the game is a tie.
# Minimax Algorithm
It is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory. 
It considers two players min and max, and min always picks up a minimum value score from game and max always picks up maximum value score.
The value for each game move is decided based on some heuristics.
# Instructions to run the project
To run the game, the AVG HTML document file needs to be ran.
The game will be displayed in the browser.
Then the turn-1 of the game will be played by the Agent .In the next turn user will select any row from 7 rows and drop a coin
Winner will be decided when one of the player has the 4 coins connected in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal fashion.
Press space to retry and play the game again.
